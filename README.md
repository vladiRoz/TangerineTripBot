## Agoda Integration

TangerineBot integrates with Agoda's affiliate program to provide hotel and flight booking options for users. The bot uses city IDs from Agoda to generate accurate booking links.

### Updating Agoda City IDs

To update the list of city IDs from Agoda's Content API:

1. Make sure you have API credentials from the [Agoda Partner Portal](https://partners.agoda.com/DeveloperPortal)
2. Add your credentials to the `.env` file:
   ```
   AGODA_API_KEY=your_agoda_api_key_here
   AGODA_API_SECRET=your_agoda_api_secret_here
   ```
3. Run the city ID fetching script:
   ```bash
   # For JavaScript version
   node fetch-agoda-cities.js
   
   # For TypeScript version
   npx ts-node fetch-agoda-cities.ts
   ```
4. The script will generate three files:
   - `agoda-cities.json`: Complete data for all cities
   - `agoda-city-ids.json`: Mapping of city names to IDs
   - `agoda-city-ids.ts`: TypeScript code ready to use in the bot

5. Review and update the `agodaCityIds` object in `agoda-affiliate.ts` with the new city IDs.
